# Hello Website (blank)

 **Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 
 This is a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ü™Ñ immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

 ## Reflection Questions
 1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 [none]

 2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
 [The first challenge that I encountered in creating this submission is dealing with Javascript because I have never seen any javascript code before. It took me some time to know what does quantities like document and do and what is used for, I had to go to the StackOverflow website and read about them to understand them. Also, the if statements at the end of the program were hard for me to do in javaScript, I did similar if statements but in c++ and then I saw the equivalent code for them in javascript. The second challenge I encountered was some code lines in CSS that I didn't see before like button1:active. even though I took a crash course in CSS, but I didn't see this one(button1:active ) before. However this one was the first time a little bit easy, I didn't have to read about it in outside resources because it was so obvious to understand the functionality of it.  ]

 3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 [does the frontend engineer do the javascript programing ? ]
 [does the backend engineer do the html and css programing ?]
 [do we use PHP in the databse of the website?]
 [does the full stack engineer able to do a website by his own?]
 [how long will it take me to be a professional web developer?]

 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 [I wolud try to make a button that can mute this game because the frequencies of the buttons are so loud so maybe someone would like to play this game but without any sound or at least make it optional for the person who is going to play this game. ]
